Using Combinatorial Optimization and Game Theory concepts to build a general AI game bot
Using Neuroevolution and RL to train an agent, with learnt policies being represented dynamically in a memory storage.

In contemporary RL, policy search methods can be broken down into gradient-based methods, also known as policy gradient methods, and methods that do not rely on the gradient. Gradient-free methods include evolutionary algorithms. ES and GA are similar terms referring to this very approach. 

This project is likely to end up being the virtual agent that the [ROSCOG](https://github.com/blackvitriol/ROSCOG) project aims.
